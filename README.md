Personal Data Protocol
======================

A project to create a decoupled personal data storage for anyone.
This is just one example, lovingly hacked together in a version of ECMAscript.

This example presents as a *simple* [0] overlay, into which you can type your data.
The data is encrypted [1] and stored in your browser.

Take it for a spin

Add the bookmarklet.js to your browser and click to load.

History
--------

This started out back in 2010 as js_list, (part of a general obsessive compulsive desire to list films that I'd seen and the like.)

Thanks
-------

a Orteil de http://orteil.dashnet.org/ for CookieClicker - without which the huge improvements to the overlay from version 0.01
 would not have happened, (though the improvements themselves were inspired by FrozenCookies, CookieMoster and CookieMaster.

[0] Feel free to create a stripped down version, (keep only what you actually use) or a much **much** more complicated version 
[1] No encryption in the first version. I'm still getting mdp/gibberish-aes and SJCL to play with openPGP.js and others  [2].
